Description: JdeRobot is a software development suite for robotics and computer vision applications. 
 The applications are made up of a collection of concurrent processes (named components) that
 interoperate among them. They exchange messages using ICE communication middleware. The components may 
 run in a distributed network of computers and may be written in several languages (C++, Python, JavaScript...). 
 JdeRobot includes a collection of drivers and tools.
